# Visualizing a year of the sky

What does the sky in your city look like over the course of a year? Was there a month where all you could see was clouds (Portland)? Or is your year full of so much sun it's almost too much (Los Angeles)?

Light areas indicate sunshine and clear sky, darker areas indicate increasing cloud cover, black indicates night. The data is based on a satellite reanalysis from a database archived at NCDC.

This visualization shows cloud cover over the course of 2011 for three sample cities (more to come!). The cloud cover data is based on a satellite reanalysis from a database archived at NCDC.

# More about the data

Integrated Surface Data (ISD) is digital data set DSI-3505, archived at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The ISD database is composed of worldwide surface weather observations from over 20,000 stations, collected and stored from sources such as the Automated Weather Network (AWN), the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), and data keyed from paper forms.

# Inspiration

Inspired by the annual sunshine record I found through Edward Tufte's classic book _[The Visual Display of Quantative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)_, in which Tufte cites F.J. Monkhouse and H.R. Wilkinson's book _Maps and Diagrams_ as the original source.
